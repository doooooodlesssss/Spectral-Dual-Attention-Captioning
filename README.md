**A Frequency-Domain Dual Attention and Spectral Fusion Framework for Robust Image Captioning with Instruction-Tuned VLM Caption Refinement.**

## Overview

This repository presents a **novel image captioning architecture** that integrates **frequency-domain spectral attention**, **dual-branch visual reasoning**, and **instruction-tuned visual language model (VLM) refinement** for generating accurate, detailed, and grounded image captions.

The framework fuses **YOLOv8-based object detection** and **Xception-based scene classification** using **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** in the frequency domain. It then applies a **Spectral Attention Module** using FFT to capture long-range dependencies efficiently, followed by a **GRU-based decoder** and an **LLM-guided refinement stage** for factual correctness.

## Key Features & Architecture
This framework improves upon classical CNN+RNN architectures, resulting in improved performance on the MSCOCO-2014 dataset.

### Key Contributions
* **Dual-Stream Encoder:** Object-level features from YOLOv8 + scene-level features from Xception.
* **Dual Bahdanau Attention:** Independent attention over object and scene embeddings.
* **Frequency-Domain Fusion (DCT):** Low-frequency spectral merging for compact and meaningful representations.
* **Spectral Attention Module (FFT-based):** Captures global feature interactions with reduced complexity.
* **GRU Caption Decoder:** Generates draft captions.
* **VLM Refinement:** Multimodal LLM (e.g., MiniGPT-4/LLaVA) improves caption factuality and grounding.

## Codebase & Notebooks
* **Main Project Code:** The main, runnable code for the entire project is located at:
    `src/improv_imgcap.py`

* **Colab Notebooks:** All experimental and development notebooks used for this project are located in the `colab_nb/` folder.

## Base Repository
This work builds upon and extends the baseline architecture from the following open-source repository:

[abdelhadie-amalla/image_captioning](https://github.com/abdelhadie-almalla/image_captioning)

Our framework enhances the original CNN–GRU pipeline with dual attention, frequency-domain fusion, spectral attention, and instruction-tuned VLM caption refinement.

## Quick Start
1.  Create a Python environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  The main execution script is `src/improv_imgcap.py`.

3.  Edit `configs/config.yaml` to point to your local dataset and weight locations.

## Usage
Run the main project stages using the provided scripts:
1.  **Run feature extraction:**
    ```bash
    bash scripts/extract_features.sh
    ```
2.  **Train the model:**
    ```bash
    bash scripts/train_model.sh
    ```
3.  **Evaluate the model:**
    ```bash
    bash scripts/evaluate_model.sh
    ```
4.  **Produce refined captions:**
    *(The VLM refinement wrapper uses the rule-based fallback by default)*
    ```bash
    bash scripts/refine_captions.sh
    ```
